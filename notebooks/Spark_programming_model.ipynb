    "- a spark application consists of a driver program that launches various parallel operations on a cluster\n",
    "    - the driver contains application's main function and defines distributes datasets on the cluster,\n",

    "    - represents a connection to a computing cluste. It is used to create and manipulate distributed datasets and shared variables\n",

    "- to run their operations, driver programms typically manage a number of nodes called **executors**\n",

    "- the Spark shell provides an easy and convenient way to quickly prototype certain operations without having to develop a full program, packaging it and then deploying it\n",
